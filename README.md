# Molecular Binding Data Challenge 
This repository contains a cleaned and anonymized version of a machine learning and data preprocessing pipeline originally developed for a technical data science exercise. All proprietary data has been removed, and synthetic examples are used for illustrative purposes.

## Background

The original task was based on a synthetic dataset simulating fluorescence intensity data generated from a high-throughput molecular screening platform. The challenge involved:

- Correcting for background fluorescence and noise.
- Identifying statistically significant molecular hits.
- Analyzing the contributions of building blocks (BB1, BB2, BB3) to binding affinity.
- Training a regression model to predict molecular binding intensity using one-hot encoded building block combinations.

Due to confidentiality, no real data is included in this repository. All visualizations and modeling steps were rebuilt using synthetic inputs that mimic the format and complexity of the original data.
